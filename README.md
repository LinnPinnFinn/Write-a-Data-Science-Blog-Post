# Write a Data Science Blog Post
Project part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree

## Project Motivation
As an aspiring data scientist myself, I am interested in understanding what to focus on when trying to break into the data science industry. To understand this better, I am trying answer some questions related to this with the help of survey data from Kaggle's yearly DS & ML survey for 2019:

1. What education or learning platforms should I focus on in becoming a Data Scientist?
2. How do different education levels and learning platforms relate to compensation?
3. What programming language should I learn?
4. What biases might respondents have in recommending which programming language to learn?

**An accompanying blog post that discusses the results of this analysis in non-technical terms can be [found here](https://medium.com/@linn.ohlsson/what-should-you-focus-on-as-an-aspiring-data-scientist-cfae11b70d88).**

## Installations
Reguired installations:
- Jupyter Notebooks (Anaconda Distribution)
- Python 3.6.7

Required packages:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## File Description
- **'Write a Data Science Blog Post.ipynb'**: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis
- **'Write a Data Science Blog Post.html'**: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis in HTML format
- **'multiple_choice_responses.csv'**: main data file with all survey data (excluding text responses)
- **'questions_only.csv'**: data file with question names and descriptions
- **'survey_schema.csv'**: data file with survey schema, showing if respondents have been excluded from certain questions based on answers to other questions

## Summary of Results
Overall, the data we have used help to answer the questions we wanted to explore. We can learn by looking at what kind of education data scientists active in the industry have, what learning platforms they use to improve their data science skills and the level of compensation they have, to understand what kind of education is attractive and what level of compensation it could result in. We also explored what programming language to focus on, by using responses from data scientists directly, of which programming language they would recommend an aspiring data scientist to learn first. Lastly, we saw that there is bias in which programming languages the resondents would recommend to learn, especially for Python and R.
